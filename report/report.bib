	abstract = {Evolutionary Computing is the collective name for a range of problem-solving techniques based on principles of biological evolution, such as natural selection and genetic inheritance. These techniques are being increasingly widely applied to a variety of problems, ranging from practical applications in industry and commerce to leading-edge scientific research. This book presents the first complete overview of this exciting field aimed directly at lecturers and graduate and undergraduate students. It is also meant for those who wish to apply evolutionary computing to a particular problem or within a given application area. To this group the book is valuable because it presents {EC} as something to be used rather than just studied. Last, but not least, this book contains quick-reference information on the current state-of-the-art in a wide range of related topics, so it is of interest not just to evolutionary computing specialists but to researchers working in other fields.},

	abstract = {Traffic congestion, and the consequent loss of time, money, quality of life, and higher pollution, is currently one of the most important problems in cities, and several approaches have been proposed to reduce it. In this paper, we propose a novel formulation of the traffic light scheduling problem in order to alleviate it. This novel formulation of the problem allows more realistic scenarios to be modeled, and as a result, it becomes much harder to solve in comparison to previous formulations. The proposal of more advanced and efficient techniques than those applied in past research is thus required. We propose the application of diversity-based multi-objective optimizers, which have shown to provide promising results when addressing single-objective problems. The wide experimental evaluation performed over a set of real-world instances demonstrates the good performance of our proposed diversity-based multi-objective method to tackle traffic at a large scale, especially in comparison to the best-performing single-objective optimizer previously proposed in the literature. Consequently, in this paper, we provide new state-of-the-art algorithmic schemes to address the traffic light scheduling problem that can deal with a whole city, instead of just a few streets and junctions, with a higher level of detail than the one found in present studies due to our micro-analysis of streets.},

It has severe impact on traffic flow management, energy consumption and vehicular emissions, as well as on urban noise. The vast number of traffic lights in modern cities increases the complexity of the scheduling problem and, at the same time, urgently needs for efficient algorithms that optimize the light cycle programs. In this work, we propose a solution for the traffic light scheduling problem by using Differential Evolution, and investigate the benefits of parallelism on this complex problem. For understanding the impact in the city, the popular micro-simulator {SUMO} is used. We evaluate our approach on close-to-reality problem scenarios consisting of two large urban areas located in the cities of Málaga, Spain, and Paris, France. Our results are promising and encourage further investigation of parallel approaches to enable scalability.},

In concrete, in this work we focus on the improvement of the traffic flow with the global purpose of reducing contaminant emissions ({CO}2 and {NOx}) and fuel consumption in the analyzed areas. For the sake of standardization, we follow European Union reference framework for traffic emissions, called {HandBook} Emission {FActors} ({HBEFA}). As a case study, we have concentrated in two extensive urban areas in the cities of Malaga and Seville (in Spain). After several comparisons between different optimisation techniques (Differential Evolution and Random Search), as well as other solutions provided by experts, our proposal is shown to obtain significant reductions of fuel consumption and gas emissions.},

Nevertheless, very few publications in the current literature tackle this problem by means of automatic intelligent systems, and, when they do, they focus on limited areas with elementary traffic light schedules. In this paper, we propose an optimization approach in which a particle swarm optimizer ({PSO}) is able to find successful traffic light cycle programs. The solutions obtained are simulated with simulator of urban mobility, a well-known microscopic traffic simulator. For this study, we have tested two large and heterogeneous metropolitan areas with hundreds of traffic lights located in the cities of Bahía Blanca in Argentina (American style) and Málaga in Spain (European style). Our algorithm is shown to obtain efficient traffic light cycle programs for both kinds of cities. In comparison with expertly predefined cycle programs (close to real ones), our {PSO} achieved quantitative improvements for the two main objectives: 1) the number of vehicles that reach their destination and 2) the overall journey time.},

Therefore, improving the efficiency of the traffic flow is a mandatory task in order to mitigate such critical problems. In this article, a Swarm Intelligence approach is proposed for the optimal scheduling of traffic lights timing programs in metropolitan areas. By doing so, the traffic flow of vehicles can be improved with the final goal global target of reducing their fuel consumption and gas emissions ({CO} and {NOx}). In this work we optimize the traffic lights timing programs and analyze their effect in pollution by following the standard {HBEFA} as the traffic emission model. Specifically, we focus on two large and heterogeneous urban scenarios located in the cities of Malaga and Seville (in Spain). When compared to the traffic lights timing programs designed by experts close to real ones, the proposed strategy obtains significant reductions in terms of the emission rates (23.3 \% {CO} and 29.3 \% {NOx}) and the total fuel consumption.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary Computing is the collective name for a range of problem-solving techniques based on principles of biological evolution, such as natural selection and genetic inheritance. These techniques are being increasingly widely applied to a variety of problems, ranging from practical applications in industry and commerce to leading-edge scientific research. This book presents the first complete overview of this exciting field aimed directly at lecturers and graduate and undergraduate students. It is also meant for those who wish to apply evolutionary computing to a particular problem or within a given application area. To this group the book is valuable because it presents {EC} as something to be used rather than just studied. Last, but not least, this book contains quick-reference information on the current state-of-the-art in a wide range of related topics, so it is of interest not just to evolutionary computing specialists but to researchers working in other fields.},

	abstract = {Roulette-wheel selection is a frequently used method in genetic and evolutionary algorithms or in modeling of complex networks. Existing routines select one of N individuals using search algorithms of O(N) or O(log(N)) complexity. We present a simple roulette-wheel selection algorithm, which typically has O(1) complexity and is based on stochastic acceptance instead of searching. We also discuss a hybrid version, which might be suitable for highly heterogeneous weight distributions, found, for example, in some models of complex networks. With minor modifications, the algorithm might also be used for sampling with fitness cut-off at a certain value or for sampling without replacement.},
